# Ani-Map
Ani-Map is a user-friendly and innovative Android application developed in Java, designed to enhance the experience of safari travelers by making it easier for them to spot and identify animals during their expeditions. Leveraging the power of real-time user-generated content, Ani-Map creates a dynamic and interactive safari map that displays "Events" reported by fellow travelers. Through this app, users can share their exciting wildlife encounters, contribute valuable observations, and collaborate with others to create a comprehensive guide to the animal kingdom within the safari.
